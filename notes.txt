 * `main.py`: The entry point of the application. It initializes the World, creates the Butterfly
     objects, and manages the main simulation loop (butterfly_behaviours). It also handles user input
     for creating "food" for the butterflies.
   * `world.py`: Defines the World class, which creates the main tkinter window and canvas. It also
     has classes for Obstacle and Food.
   * `butterfly.py`: This is the core of the simulation. It defines the Butterfly class, its movement
     (move, seek, wander, separate), and its interaction with the environment (boundaries,
     avoid_obstacle). It also includes implementations for a Perceptron and a NeuralNetwork to control
      the butterfly's behavior, which is quite interesting.
   * `PVector.py`: A helper class for 2D vector mathematics, used for position, velocity, and forces.
   * `Matrix.py`: A basic matrix library.
   * `NeuralNetwork.py`: A three-layer neural network implementation.
   * `Perceptron.py`: A single-neuron perceptron implementation.


  In the future, to install all the required packages at once, you can run the following command in
  your terminal:
  pip install -r requirements.txt
